# Example Newton fractals 

This code generates a fractal image using the Newton-Raphson method. The fractal is generated by iterating over all the pixels in an image, and for each pixel, performing the Newton-Raphson method starting with the complex number corresponding to the pixel's coordinates. Depending on which root the iteration converges to, the pixel is given a corresponding color. The fractal that is generated is of the function f(z) = z^3 - 1, which has 3 roots at 1, -0.5 + (sqrt(3)/2)i, and -0.5 - (sqrt(3)/2)i.

Newton fractals are fractals generated by coloring each point in the complex plane based on which root it converges to when using Newton's rootfinding method. The program is set to generate the fractal for the function f(z) = z^3 - 1, and the amount of points that converge to each of the three roots, or do not converge at all are counted. The serial version of the code is based on code by Mitch Richling (https://www.mitchr.me/SS/newton/index.html) and is parallelized using both OpenMP and OpenACC. Code timing is done using timing code provided by Professor Chandrasekaran.
