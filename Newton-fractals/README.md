# Example Newton fractals 
## From original [repo](https://github.com/rdean-udel/CISC372-Project)

Newton fractals are fractals generated by coloring each point in the complex plane based on which root it converges to when using Newton's rootfinding method. The program is set to generate the fractal for the function f(z) = z^3 - 1, and the amount of points that converge to each of the three roots, or do not converge at all are counted. The serial version of the code is based on code by Mitch Richling (https://www.mitchr.me/SS/newton/index.html) and is parallelized using both OpenMP and OpenACC. Code timing is done using timing code provided by Professor Chandrasekaran.

## Build Instructions

To compile the code with a specific target, use one of the following commands:

    - For GCC with GPU target (OpenACC):
        ```bash
        export ACC_DEVICE_TYPE=nvidia|radeon
        make gcc_gpu
        ```

    - For GCC without GPU offloading:
        ```bash
        export ACC_DEVICE_TYPE=host
        make gcc_serial
        ```

    - For NVC with NVIDIA Tesla GPU target:
        ```bash
        make nvc_gpu
        ```

    - For NVC with multicore CPU target:
        ```bash
        export ACC_NUM_THREADS=4|8|16
        make nvc_multicore
        ```

    - For NVC targeting the host CPU:
        ```bash
        make nvc_serial
        ```

After running one of the above commands, the executable file (e.g., `gcc_gpu`) will be generated in the same directory.


To run the executable with a specified command (e.g., `./nvc_gpu`), use the following command:

```bash
./nvc_gpu
```

To clean up and remove the compiled executable, use the following command:

```bash
make clean
```
