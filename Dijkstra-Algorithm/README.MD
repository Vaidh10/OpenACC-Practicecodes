# Example Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Make benchmarks

Configure the build and run commands.
    * Enter the build command. A Makefile that uses the nvc compiler is provided. If you don't have Make or nvc, you can enter the compiler invocation directly. Otherwise :
        * For an OpenACC enabled code: `make acc`
    * And then enter: `make run`
