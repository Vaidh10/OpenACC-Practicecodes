# Knapsack Problem with OpenACC



## From original [repo](https://github.com/bdelled/Parallel_Project)

This code attempts to parallelize the Knapsack Problem What is the Knapsack Problem? It is an optimazation problem in which you take a set of items, each with a given value and weight, and determine what is the highest value combination of items that can be placed in a knapsack that has a set weight maximum. The two solutions that are attempted to be parallelized are a Brute-Force Solution and a Dynamic Programming Solution and the parallelization software used is OpenACC
