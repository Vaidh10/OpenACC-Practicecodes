# Example Raytracer-Project
## From original [repo](https://github.com/AKenney31/Raytracer_project)

Raytracing is a basic method to create 3 dimensional graphics. It works by shooting rays out into a scene and if it makes contact with an object in the scene, it calculates what shade the pixel should be based on the position of the lightsource. We made an orthographic raytracer, meaning that it shoots a ray straight out in the z direction from each pixel in the window. This is less efficient than using the camera approach to this problem when you shoot rays out from a camera's point of view. The orthographic approach is better suited for our project because it is effected by the size of the window. So we start with 800 X 800 which performs pretty well, and then we bump the window size to 10000 X 10000 to see how the serial version will perform compared to the parallel version. Keep in mind that on the 10000 X 10000 version, you will not be able to view the ppm file, but it will still run all the way and produce an output so we can still measure it's performance. The parallel version was made using openmp to paralellize over CPUs. We ran the code on the supercomputer Bridges 2 located in Pennsylvania.
